THIS PACKAGE IS PURELY EXPERIMENTAL
==========================

This Julia package is an extension to the [`ApproxFun`](https://github.com/dlfivefifty/ApproxFun.jl) package,
to build operator matrices for the Spherical Harmonic spectral method on the sphere.

Spherical Harmonics
==============

Implements spectral methods for solving PDEs.
The method results in matrix operators which are "banded-block-banded".

All implementations are experimental.

The Julia implementation requires ApproxFun:
